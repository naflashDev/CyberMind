Upon discovery of the attack, the organization states that it began its investigation and cooperation with law enforcement officials.","Below, security leaders discuss the implications of this cyberattack.","This breach underscores the need for organizations to adopt an “assume breach” mindset — not only in theory but in practice, especially for those providing services to financial institutions and other critical infrastructure organizations. That means investing not just in preventive measures, but also in controls that enable rapid detection, containment, and remediation of attacks. This approach helps limit the scale of a breach and supports faster recovery.","have always been a desirable target for cybercriminals, although as a vector in enabling targeted attacks they were rarer because they required deep knowledge of internal systems, executive profiles, business system connections, and IT infrastructure to be highly effective. Now, AI is making this level of targeting available to a much broader class of threat actors who can profile, conduct reconnaissance, and launch a sophisticated, cost-effective targeted attack with precision and speed.","What was once limited by manual capacity and expertise is now able to be delivered as a commodity ranked by likelihood of successful compromise, maintaining anonymity, and value of the breach.","This new capability available at scale to cyber criminals requires defenders to rethink their approach to protecting their attack surface, and to consider their entire connected ecosystem of third parties and supply chain in their monitoring or active compromises. Being able to alert when key third parties are at risk or actively compromised creates the time to counter the threat within your environment; this requires knowledge of what data is held by the third party, the extent to which you are reliant on that third party for critical business operations, and the nature of the connection between the organizations and the extent the compromise of the third party could lead to a compromise of your environment.","Lost data lasts forever, it can give visibility beyond the account information of a customer, provide understanding into how an organization classifies information, normal nomenclature, and operational norms, that can be used later in a separate type of attack; organizations are often limited by how fast they can change technology, infrastructure, and operating structures making some data highly value as a roadmap to illuminate internal process. Individual data can be combined with information from other sources to provide a treasure trove of ill-gotten intelligence for cyber criminals to utilize over years to come.","There has been a substantial rise in reliance on third-party service apps and vendors across Wall Street firms in recent years, with many banks offloading core processes, such as mortgage servicing, analytics, compliance, and even payment processing, to specialized technology providers. SitusAMC provides loan servicing, asset management, compliance, and valuation services to many large financial institutions.","The breach should be of significant concern to firms on Wall Street because of interconnectedness of data flows. Typically, accounting records and legal agreements contain system architecture diagrams, data-sharing clauses, SLAs, or references to internal tools which could be goldmines for attackers planning follow-on intrusions. If credentials are stolen, then there is potential of lateral movement at each of the firms who use the app, unless they have adequately designed microsegmentation or if they use cryptographic password less credentials tied to associated hardware. Though currently unknown there could also be an impact on investors if their credentials are lost. The other fallout could be regulatory scrutiny, depending on how the details of the breach evolve in the next few days.","The first thing that potentially affected enterprises should do is to",", where practically possible, especially with third-party suppliers. Then they should review the fallout of this breach to determine if they need to enhance, or adopt, a breach ready approach using microsegmentation and just-in-time cryptographic authentication, especially to isolate suppliers and customers from other critical systems.","Jordyn Alger is the managing editor for","magazine.

Now, five experts share their predictions for 2026 below.","The explosive growth in AI usage represents the single greatest operational threat to organizations, putting intellectual property (IP) and customer data at serious risk. While AI adoption is growing rapidly, enterprises are increasingly exposed to risks related to data security, third‑party AI tools,",", and governance issues. When sensitive IP or Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is entered into unsanctioned AI systems, the data may be used for model training, stored externally, or exposed in unexpected ways, leading to compliance, IP, and reputational risk.","Organizations must monitor not only sanctioned AI tools but also the growing ecosystem of “micro‑AI” extensions and plugins that can quietly extract or transmit data. A global KPMG and University of Melbourne survey of 48,340 individuals across 47 countries found that 48% of employees admitted uploading company data into public AI tools, and only 47% received formal AI training, underscoring real and growing risk of unsanctioned AI use.","In 2026, three regulatory shifts will dominate the compliance and security agenda. The EU AI Act’s full release in August will require organizations to classify systems by risk, complete conformity assessments, and maintain documentation that reshapes how AI is deployed.","At the same time, state level AI bills in Colorado, California, and New York are advancing, creating a fragmented U.S. landscape that demands careful navigation. Beyond AI, data localization and digital sovereignty mandates are accelerating worldwide, with China’s PIPL enforcement maturing, India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act gaining traction, and governments across APAC, LATAM, and Africa tightening rules on where data resides and how it moves.","Supply chain and third party risk transparency also becomes non negotiable, driven by Europe’s",", the SEC’s cybersecurity disclosure rules, and expanding critical infrastructure mandates globally. The era of trust without verification for vendors is ending, and continuous visibility into resilience is now expected.","Security practices will evolve in parallel. Continuous controls monitoring is bifurcating, with leading organizations in financial services and regulated technology operationalizing real time monitoring, while many others remain in pilot phases and struggle with foundational data gaps. Infrastructure and identity controls such as access monitoring, configuration drift, and patch compliance are increasingly automated, while process and judgment controls like segregation of duties reviews remain periodic.","SOX compliance is also expanding into API driven environments, where gateways, identity providers, automation platforms, and data pipelines all touch financial data. Automated preventive controls are replacing manual detective ones, but new risks emerge around securing the automation itself. Auditors must now ask who approves the bot posting accruals or how segregation of duties applies when service accounts execute transactions. Together, these shifts signal that compliance and security are converging into a model of real time assurance, where resilience depends on both regulatory navigation and technical execution.","Deepfakes are no longer limited to fake videos. They have evolved into a multimodal disinformation security threat spanning AI-generated voices, images, texts, emails and any channel where trust can be exploited. In the next year, enterprises will move from early exploration to wide-scale deployment of disinformation defense platforms, spurred by the fact that","have already encountered deepfake-based social engineering attacks.","Forward-looking organizations are establishing dedicated “trust operations” and appointing Chief Trust Officers to ensure authenticity and guard against AI-generated fraud and impersonation. Boards and regulators are also raising the stakes with global policies pushing for transparency and clear labeling of synthetic content.","that by 2026, 30% of enterprises will abandon vulnerable verifications like facial recognition as deepfakes render them unreliable, and new laws (such as the EU’s AI Act) will require clear labeling of AI-generated media.","2026 marks a pivotal shift — from general awareness of disinformation and deepfake threats to decisive enterprise action. Disinformation defense will emerge as the next cybersecurity battleground, recognized as core infrastructure and an operational necessity for maintaining organizational trust. The companies that act now will be the ones that avoid the costly impact of the next wave of cyber-enabled deception.","As quantum computing and AI converge, we are entering into a new security era, where human-designed intelligence and the laws of nature work together to make digital security a matter of physical truth, not just promised trust.","We are already witnessing the transition of","from experimentation to practical deployment. For example, self-verifying quantum random number generators (QRNGs) are now being used to generate cryptographic keys whose unpredictability can be proven using the laws of physics themselves. QRNGs such as Quantinuum’s Quantum Origin employ Bell-test-based statistical checks to confirm, in real time, that the randomness they produce cannot be explained by any classical process. In doing so, they transform randomness from something merely assumed into something physically proven. This new class of self-verifying systems marks a shift from just asserting trust to engineering it.","Furthermore, the merging of quantum devices and AI marks a pivotal moment in the evolution of digital security — an evolution that is grounded not only in computational power but also the physical laws of nature. In 2026 and beyond, AI will play a central role in this evolution. Agentic AI will enable quantum devices to mitigate errors in a self-adaptive way, making systems not only more reliable but also more scalable. Once they are significantly more developed, quantum processors will begin to accelerate AI workflows, unlocking new possibilities in data analysis, optimization, and modeling. This growing feedback loop between quantum technologies and AI is laying out the groundwork for digital security that can learn and evolve faster than the threats it faces.","will become the next mainstream access credential. While fingerprints, facial recognition, and iris scans have long been used in high-security environments like airports, advances in cloud-based access control and identity management are making biometrics far easier to deploy at scale. Consumers already use biometrics every day to unlock their phones or verify purchases, but enterprise adoption has lagged due to management complexity. As organizations look for secure, frictionless ways to manage identity, biometrics offer convenience and assurance — no badges to lose, passwords to forget, or phones to carry. As biometric identities become easier to manage within unified access control systems, they will move from specialized deployments to everyday use, redefining how organizations think about secure, seamless access.","From shadow AI to biometric security, it seems cybersecurity grows more and more complex with each passing year. While the landscape may be challenging and the threats persistent, security leaders are always looking ahead, staying prepared, and","in order to better protect their companies, assets, and people.","Jordyn Alger is the managing editor for","magazine.

It’s polite and good manners,” says Kelly Lake, VP of Strategic Programs and LATAM for Zenitel Americas. “So it's important that organizations maintain constant training for their own people, and provide intuitive security technologies at the door, like video and intercom, to make it easy for the visitor to contact the proper authorities for assistance when looking to enter a building.”","Lake concisely spells out one of the greatest challenges to visitor management: the human element. The average employee will seek to help a person who is requesting entry, whether or not the individual in question should be given access. In order to provide a beneficial customer experience, workers may unwittingly sacrifice security. However, challenges exist on the opposite end of the spectrum as well.","Robby Dunn-Bernstein, Head of Global Safety, Security, and Intelligence at GoDaddy, explains, “A notable challenge to visitor management includes balancing robust security features with a welcoming experience. Security measures, if not thoughtfully implemented, can sometimes feel overwhelming or even invasive to visitors.”","Balancing security and the guest experience can be difficult. But, if implemented effectively, visitor management systems and processes can benefit the guest experience rather than hinder it.","“Visitor management is the foundation of","— it’s where security truly begins,” says Christina Alexandropoulou, Security & Market Safety Cluster Manager at Philip Morris International.","Visitor management and access control are essential parts of protecting an organization, often acting as a first line of defense not just for a physical location, but for the safety of those inside — which could have direct impacts on the business’s reputation.","“Effective visitor management is a critical part of a comprehensive security program because corporate security truly touches nearly every aspect of a business, including the people who visit our spaces,” says Dunn-Bernstein. “We have a duty of care not just to our employees, but also to our visitors, guests, and vendors, ensuring everyone’s safety while they’re on site.”","Protecting an organization doesn’t have to be at the expense of the guest experience. When it comes to visitor management, these qualities can go hand in hand.","“Another reason to have an effective visitor management program is to help guide people once they do have access, in addition to accounting for them throughout their journey in the facility,” explains Lake. “Known individuals such as employees and vendors will likely know where to go once they gain access, but others will not. In an emergency, for example, they won’t know the evacuation points.”","Dunn-Bernstein asserts, “Ultimately, a quality VMS will help to support a safe and secure environment for everyone, but also demonstrate your ongoing commitment to care, compliance, and preparedness of your guests.”","Technology alone will not create effective visitor management practices within the workplace. Instead, the deliberate combination of technology and implementation strategy will lead to successful visitor management.","For example, calculated implementation of visitor management can extend the reach of an organization’s security measures. Lake states, “It’s important to incorporate technology that allows security teams to extend the perimeter further out than a reception desk. For example, an intercom placed at an exterior gate can provide valuable information to a security officer about the individual who wants access: their physical features, languages spoken, tone, emotion, and more. Are they carrying anything? Is there anyone else with them? If it’s determined that the individual should not have access, then security is ensured because the individual is not near the main entrance. Using video and audio allows you to push the perimeter back a bit further to vet someone even more than just allowing them to register with the visitor management software at a reception desk.”","Ultimately, a quality VMS will help to support a safe and secure environment for everyone, but also demonstrate your ongoing commitment to care, compliance, and preparedness of your guests.","To make the most of implemented technology and processes, organizations must","with visitor management expectations and understand their role in facilitating it.","“Start with policy and culture before technology,” advises Alexandropoulou. “A visitor management system is only as good as the people who use it. You need clear procedures, well-trained staff and leadership support.”","With so much ground to cover — literally and figuratively — it can be overwhelming for security leaders who are just starting the process of implementing visitor management systems. Dunn-Bernstein walks through some essential steps for constructive execution.","“Best practices for implementing or improving a visitor management system start with clearly defining the features your team will use. From there, it’s important to build policies and standard operating procedures around those features, ensuring teams in your organization are aligned and committed. If policies are ignored or unenforced, it can undermine your visitor protocols and the broader security framework.","“Integration is another critical, and sometimes overlooked, aspect. A quality VMS should work smoothly with your existing security infrastructure and workflows, which often requires close coordination across multiple teams. Additionally, data privacy and compliance need careful attention, particularly when sensitive personal information is being collected and stored.","“Lastly, consistent adoption across all locations and staff is essential for success. This requires ongoing training, clear communication, and visible leadership support. In the end, a well-implemented VMS should reinforce both safety and hospitality, helping to build a culture where both are valued and maintained.”","Though security is meant to be a barrier to threats, awkwardly placed security measures can feel like a barrier to the guest experience. However, with a well-instituted visitor management system, organizations can protect their space while opening it up to others.","“Visitor management is more than an operational tool — it’s part of an organization’s reputation for safety, professionalism, and trust,” states Alexandropoulou. “Whether it’s a luxury resort, a retail headquarters, or a tech facility, people want to feel that security is there to enable their experience, not restrict it. The most successful programs are those that blend empathy with efficiency —protecting people while respecting their dignity and purpose for being there.”","Jordyn Alger is the managing editor for","magazine.

It’s the difference between a quietly resolved incident and a true disaster. When a theft occurs at a blackjack table or a disturbance erupts near the slot machines, every second counts. The security officer stationed thirty feet away can prevent escalation, while the one dispatched from across the sprawling property arrives to find the situation already spiraling.","This is the fundamental challenge facing casino security teams today: not whether they have enough personnel, but whether they can deploy the right person, at the right place, at the right moment. With United States casino revenue projected to reach",", the stakes have never been higher, and the margin for error has never been smaller.","Casinos operate as cities unto themselves. Thousands of guests, employees, and vendors navigate vast properties filled with cash transactions, high-value assets, and competing operational priorities. Security, surveillance, facilities, and hospitality teams all work toward the same goal — guest safety — but they often operate in informational silos, using fragmented communication systems that make coordinated response nearly impossible.","The core problem isn’t a lack of security personnel. It’s a lack of visibility. When an incident occurs, dispatchers face an impossible question:","Traditional radio systems can broadcast a call for help, but they can’t answer this fundamental question. Teams waste precious seconds, sometimes minutes, trying to locate the nearest available responder while an incident escalates in real time.","This visibility gap creates what security leaders call the “Control Paradox”: the tension between needing total situational awareness and being overwhelmed by too much information. Legacy communication systems force leaders to monitor every channel manually, risking information overload or missing critical incidents entirely. The result? Delayed responses, misallocated resources, and preventable escalations that damage guest perception and put the property’s reputation at risk.","Luckily, modern communication platforms are eliminating this visibility gap through AI-powered intelligence and real-time coordination. These systems can monitor all communication channels simultaneously, something no human dispatcher could ever achieve, by actively scanning for the specific, user-defined topics and keywords you want to monitor. This allows them to automatically alert the right people the moment a critical incident occurs, ensuring that whether it’s a theft, a medical emergency, or a disturbance on the casino floor, this directed monitoring ensures nothing slips through the cracks.","Combined with real-time location tracking, this technology gives security leaders a live view of where every team member is positioned. When an incident is reported, dispatchers no longer guess who might be nearby. They know exactly who is closest and can deploy them instantly. This shift from guesswork to precision fundamentally changes incident response dynamics. Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA), the critical window between when an incident occurs and when help arrives, shrinks dramatically.","The security officer already stationed near the poker room can respond to a disturbance there in seconds, not minutes. The supervisor in the parking structure doesn’t get pulled away from their current zone when someone closer is available. Security leaders can identify coverage gaps in real time, reposition personnel proactively, and ensure high-risk areas always have adequate presence. During peak hours or special events, when properties handle maximum guest traffic, this visibility becomes even more critical.","When incidents are resolved before they escalate, when fights are defused before they become brawls, when thefts are stopped before suspects leave the floor, guests never know anything happened. They simply experience a property that feels safe, well-managed, and professional. That perception drives return visits and positive word-of-mouth in an industry increasingly competing against online alternatives and declining in-person visitation.","The benefits of intelligent communication systems extend well beyond security incidents. In the casino environment, safety and service are inseparable. When security teams can respond efficiently and quietly, they protect both guests and the overall guest experience. For example, a medical emergency handled swiftly and professionally becomes a story about how well the casino took care of a guest.","Modern communication platforms also solve another persistent challenge: comprehensive documentation. Casinos face some of the most rigorous compliance standards in any industry, requiring meticulous records of every incident, response, and communication. When every alert, dispatch, and message is automatically transcribed, time-stamped, logged, and archived, audits become straightforward and compliance risks decrease significantly. This automatic record-keeping eliminates the gaps and inconsistencies that plague manual documentation systems.","Perhaps most importantly, when security personnel aren’t wasting time and energy on chaotic, inefficient response protocols, they have more bandwidth to focus on what matters most: being present, attentive, and service-oriented. The security officer who resolves incidents quickly can spend more time engaging with guests, creating the approachable, professional presence that makes people feel genuinely secure. This matters for the more than","employed in the casino industry worldwide, who work hard to keep guests safe and coming back.","The Plaza Hotel & Casino in downtown Las Vegas provides a practical example of this transformation. Before upgrading its communication systems, the Plaza relied on traditional radio technology that fragmented operations across departments and left dispatchers making educated guesses about personnel location during incidents.","After adopting unified communication technology with real-time location tracking, the property experienced immediate operational improvements. Staff reported not just faster response times but also better coordination across departments. Emergency alert features that display team members’ exact locations enabled responders to reach them significantly faster than with voice-based location descriptions alone.","As casinos continue navigating the challenges of evolving threats, from insider theft and fraud to guest safety incidents, the properties that thrive will be those that invest in operational intelligence. Real-time location tracking, channel scanning, and automated transcripts all represent critical components of that intelligence infrastructure.","The technology exists today to eliminate the visibility gaps that have plagued casino security for decades. In this environment, guest perception is shaped by resolving incidents so quickly and quietly that guests are often not even aware they’ve occurred. This focus on seamlessness exists alongside two other critical realities: regulatory compliance demands perfect documentation, and every second of response time matters.

It’s the first line of defense and a critical business asset. Yet in many boardrooms, security entrances are often viewed as a cost center rather than an investment. Today’s security leaders have an opportunity to shift that narrative by demonstrating how modern entrance solutions deliver tangible, long-term value for the business.",", such as optical turnstiles, security revolving doors, and mantrap portals, offer far more than controlled access.

Unsupervised security entrances reduce or eliminate the need for on-site guards at building access points. This significantly reduces labor costs while improving consistency. Unlike a human, a security portal won’t wave someone through without proper credentials, and it never takes a break. By physically preventing tailgating and enforcing single-person entry, these systems close one of the most persistent gaps in access control.","In high-security environments, such as data centers or R&D labs, mantrap portals provide multi-factor authentication and biometric scanning, offering unmatched control over who gains entry. In corporate lobbies, optical turnstiles with barriers offer a sleek yet secure solution that seamlessly integrates into modern design while helping to detect and deter unauthorized entry attempts.","By reducing human error, these systems not only enhance security but also free up security personnel to focus on higher-value tasks like threat detection, emergency response, or investigations, all of which align better with the organization's overall risk posture.","Even the most advanced entrance system can become a liability if it fails. A non-functioning revolving door or turnstile can cause delays and also jeopardize your physical security and operational continuity. In some cases, the result is a facility left unsecured or reliant on expensive, temporary security staff.","Security leaders need to frame entrance uptime as part of business continuity planning. A disruption in access control can slow down productivity, damage employee and visitor confidence, and even result in regulatory noncompliance if sensitive areas are left vulnerable. That’s why proactive, preventative maintenance is more than a “nice to have.” It’s an essential part of protecting your investment and your facility.","A structured service agreement delivers predictable support, reduces long-term costs, and extends the life of your entrance equipment. By locking in routine inspections, diagnostics, and updates, organizations can stay ahead of issues instead of reacting to them.","Preventative maintenance includes tasks like lubricating moving parts, replacing worn components, running diagnostic tests and updating firmware — all of which are necessary for ensuring security entrances operate as designed. It also means maintaining compliance with safety and emergency egress standards, ensuring the system supports evacuation protocols and meets regulatory expectations.","Customized service agreements allow for flexibility based on traffic volume, entry type and risk tolerance. For instance, a high-traffic corporate headquarters may require quarterly inspections, while a low-traffic server room might only need bi-annual servicing. In both cases, scheduled support minimizes downtime and protects against costly emergency repairs","Another factor gaining attention with the C-suite is sustainability. Security entrances can support green building goals by reducing energy loss, particularly revolving doors and portals that help maintain indoor climate control. Moreover, retrofitting older systems with new technology (rather than replacing them) supports waste reduction and extends product lifecycles.","A cradle-to-cradle approach for security entrances supports ESG goals while boosting ROI. By maintaining and upgrading existing systems through proactive care, organizations can reduce capital expenditures, prevent hardware from being sent to landfills, and preserve the aesthetics and functionality of their current infrastructure.","Security leaders must speak the language of business to earn executive buy-in. That means quantifying the benefits of entrance systems in terms of reduced labor costs, lowered risk of breach, extended product life, regulatory compliance, and brand reputation. A single tailgating incident that leads to data loss or theft can cost far more than the price of an optical turnstile or portal. Preventing such incidents isn’t just about security, but also about risk management and financial prudence.","Ultimately, modern security entrances are more than technology upgrades. They are strategic assets that improve protection, streamline operations, and reinforce an organization’s image. With a structured service plan and long-term maintenance, they deliver reliability, compliance, and measurable business value.","By positioning security entrances within the broader business value conversation, security leaders can elevate their role and clearly show the C-suite how these systems protect both the facility and the bottom line.","Joseph Seagriff currently serves as Boon Edam’s vice president of sales, having been in the security entrance industry for more than 20 years. During his 12 years with Boon Edam, he has held various roles including business development manager, enterprise accounts manager, and global accounts manager, with his most recent role being director of enterprise accounts for the east region. Seagriff graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a Bachelor of Science in Management, and resides in Niskayuna, New York.","You must have JavaScript enabled to enjoy a limited number of articles over the next 30 days.","Sponsored Content is a special paid section where industry companies provide high quality, objective, non-commercial content around topics of interest to the","audience.

Threat actors routinely time attacks to exploit the perfect storm of holiday season pressures: record transaction volume, operational urgency, strained IT resources, and the absolute necessity of uninterrupted uptime. From ransomware and data exfiltration campaigns to credential theft and account takeovers, attacks reliably surge during the period when retailers can least afford disruption.","Complicating matters further, retailers are now confronting a new wave of AI-driven and automated cyber threats. According to the Retail & Hospitality Information Sharing and Analysis Center’s","report, organizations should expect a surge in sophisticated automated bot attacks timed to coincide with peak seasonal shopping periods.","In this new reality,","for an entirely new level of speed, sophistication, and persistence in cyberattacks.","For retailers, education and awareness remain the most effective early defenses against holiday season cybercrime. You can’t protect what you don’t understand, and during a time when both consumer activity and adversary operations surge, visibility into potential threats and common attack patterns becomes indispensable.","Building that awareness starts with understanding the tactics adversaries rely on during high-traffic periods. Below are three of the most common and damaging attacks facing retailers during the holiday rush:","Knowing retailers are under immense pressure to maintain flawless uptime, attackers often deploy ransomware or data theft operations immediately before major sales events, when downtime would be most catastrophic.","Modern extortion campaigns frequently combine encryption with large-scale data exfiltration to maximize leverage. Forced to choose between business continuity and financial loss, retailers may find the cost of downtime far exceeding the ransom itself. Under these conditions, attackers gain extraordinary bargaining power, making seasonal extortion one of the most damaging and disruptive threats retailers face.","Retailers are also contending with a surge in AI-generated phishing and social-engineering scams that impersonate core business processes, with a goal to exploit customer loyalty and",".","Threat actors now use generative AI (genAI) to craft fraudulent supplier invoices, shipping updates, refund alerts, and support messages that closely mimic legitimate communications in tone, format, and branding. Because these messages appear polished, contextually relevant, and grammatically flawless, they increasingly bypass traditional phishing filters and can trick even vigilant recipients into clicking, paying, or sharing sensitive information.","Modern adversaries also leverage multi‑modal genAI, which is capable of synthesizing not just text but also voice and image content, to convincingly mimic customer service representatives or logistics partners. This makes real‑time impersonation via chat, email, phone, or both scalable and persuasive, underscoring the need for layered verification and adaptive filtering beyond text‑only detection defenses.","Attackers are aggressively targeting customer accounts by reusing or purchasing stolen login credentials at scale. Retail accounts packed with stored payment cards, loyalty points, and gift-card balances offer quick and profitable opportunities for exploitation.","One rapidly growing tactic is gift card draining, a low-effort, high-yield method that allows attackers to quietly monetize stolen access with minimal detection. Because these intrusions often unfold quietly within authenticated user sessions, strong observability, behavioral analytics, and anomaly identification are essential to catching unusual patterns before they erode customer confidence and brand reputation.","Beyond individual credential theft, retailers are also facing an escalation in bot‑driven credential‑stuffing and API‑abuse attacks. Automated bots continuously test stolen usernames across loyalty apps, promo systems, and payment APIs to exploit weak password reuse and poorly monitored endpoints. These attacks can occur at a scale and a speed beyond human monitoring, leading to account lockouts, fraudulent purchases, and lost revenue. Tight API authentication, intelligent rate‑limiting, and credential monitoring services are now essential for mitigating this form of automated fraud.","By equipping every level of the retail organization — from executive leadership to frontline staff — with timely intelligence on active threats and common attack vectors, retailers can spot warning signs earlier, make faster and more informed decisions, and shrink the window of opportunity for attackers during peak season.","With clearer visibility and current threat intelligence, retailers can move from awareness to action, building the operational resilience needed to protect both revenue and customer trust during peak trading periods. The following recommendations outline the foundational steps for preventing, detecting, and responding to holiday season attacks.","Preparation is everything during the holidays. Conduct tabletop exercises well before peak season to test, refine, and validate incident response plans, clarify roles, and confirm that escalation paths are understood across leadership, IT, security, and customer facing teams. Ensure:","Frequent, realistic practice reduces uncertainty and accelerates response when minutes matter.","Attackers target what’s exposed, and retail environments have a wide footprint. Continuously inventory and evaluate all externally facing assets, including web portals, APIs, cloud applications, point-of-sale (POS) integrations, and remote-access systems. Prioritize remediation based on exploitability, asset criticality and business impact. Pay particular attention to end-of-life systems, legacy infrastructure and seasonal workloads that may not receive regular patching.","Proactive attack surface reduction dramatically lowers the attacker's options.","Peak season stress creates the perfect conditions for human error, which is exactly what attackers exploit. Reinforce a “Pause → Verify → Act” mindset across the organization. Employees should be encouraged to slow down before clicking links, processing refunds, approving invoices or responding to urgent requests. Key steps include:","A calm, verification-first culture significantly reduces the risk of AI-enhanced social engineering campaigns.","Real-time detection and response are essential when attackers move fast and retailers cannot afford downtime. Ensure continuous monitoring across endpoints, POS and retail business systems, and eCommerce platforms.","Take advantage of genAI as a force‑multiplier for threat detection and response, using machine learning and behavioral analytics to triage alerts, correlate indicators, and automate containment. When paired with playbook‑driven orchestration, AI accelerates investigation while ensuring threats are neutralized before they escalate into business disrupting incidents.","Holiday operations depend on a complex ecosystem of external partners. Reassess third-party risks by validating:","A compromised partner can be a direct path into retail systems, making supply chain due diligence an essential layer of defense.","The holiday rush is more than a stress test for sales, it’s a stress test for cyber resilience.","Retailers that follow the above roadmap can safeguard their business, protect customer trust and maintain operational confidence when the stakes are highest.","Jack Cherkas is Global CISO at Syntax.","You must have JavaScript enabled to enjoy a limited number of articles over the next 30 days.","Sponsored Content is a special paid section where industry companies provide high quality, objective, non-commercial content around topics of interest to the","audience.

And a few years after the “Great Resignation” led to a very tight labor market, hiring and retention challenges seem to have eased.","With more than 300,000 employees in 377 offices and revenues of more than $13.2 billion in North America, Allied Universal sounded the alarm on a major escalation in threats against U.S. executives in its 2025 World Security Report.","The firm’s research found that nearly half (46%) of U.S.-based chief security officers (CSO) have experienced greater threats against their executives over the past two years, with technology and pharmaceutical companies the most likely to provide executive protection for senior leaders — both at 40% compared to the national average of 33%.","In addition, Allied Universal’s annual report found that economic instability is the most concerning hazard for the coming year, with 44% of the 2,350 chief security officers who responded citing that threat, up from 33% in 2024. And 64% of U.S. security heads expect budget increases for physical security, with employee security training and upskilling the most common top priority, mentioned by nearly half of them (46%).","“We are in a different security environment in the past 12 to 18 months, with this acceleration of economic instability, social instability and protests, and all this kind of activity,” says Rachelle Loyear, Vice President of Integrated Security Solutions at Allied Universal. “We are seeing greater demands placed on the people who stand on the actual front line,” with 83% of CSOs who responded to the survey agreeing with that statement.","Allied Universal and its clients are working together to combat these threats with barriers and perimeter control, an officer training regimen focused on de-escalation when faced with “people who have very heated ideas,” and technological advancements such as the use of AI in video analytics to catch unwanted behaviors and trigger alerts, Loyear says. A potential bad actor can be issued an automated warning that they’re on camera and given a chance to disperse before a human guard confronts them, she explains.","With 95,000 employees in 180 offices and revenue of $3.3 billion in North America, GardaWorld Security — U.S. has focused on hiring and retention through its “ambassador” program over the past year, reducing turnover among security professionals year-over-year, says Ally Happel, Senior Vice President, sales for GardaWorld Security - U.S. The company has leveraged technology to help with training, launching a new learning management system that uses AI to help with simulations.","Looking for a reprint of this article?","From high-res PDFs to custom plaques,","!","Companies are less focused on cost savings than they were immediately post-COVID and more on security optimization, building out stronger resiliency and emergency plans in the wake of political unrest, Happel says. “Do we have the right training posture?” she says. “Do we have individuals on the ground with the right soft skills? It’s no longer just, ‘Does this person meet the job description based on their qualifications.”","Christopher Brooks, Chief Operating Officer of ECAM, a GardaWorld company specializing in live surveillance and AI-enabled security, says customers are heavily focused on how best to integrate guarding and technology to achieve a more powerful security posture. And they’re very curious about — but also wary of — artificial intelligence. “What tools can I use and not use?” he says. “There aren’t a lot of off-the-shelf products that are AI, specific to remote video monitoring. That’s a key gap that ECAM fills for our customers.”","But AI is proving quite useful in sub-optimal conditions like darkness or bad weather to “quiet the noise” and help those monitoring camera systems, for example, see movement where it’s not supposed to be, Brooks says. “It’s allowed me to see more clearly what I need to see, when I need to see it,” he says, adding that ECAM’s proprietary technologies have led to an increase in apprehension and arrests.","The company’s “Blackout” AI technology on its more than 140,000 cameras detects threats faster than the human eye, often in under a second, says Alex Vourkoutiotis, Chief Technology Officer at ECAM. “This allows for immediate intervention — such as a guard or law enforcement response, or verbal broadcast warning. It has even prevented loss of life in several documented cases,” he says. In addition, ECAM’s “Integra” AI-powered video technology increases detection accuracy by up to 40% and identification range up to 50%, he adds.","With guards stationed all over the globe, sometimes in remote and/or risky conditions, ADM has worked to automate guarding posts where possible, while being mindful that they’re not “losing touch” with the overall security posture, says Brian Howell, Vice President and Global Head of Security. He’d like to “in-source” key positions in the guard force to ensure greater cultural integration, given “enormous turnover in the guarding world. They’re in a constant train and re-train situation,” he says. “Training programs that might have been more embedded in a legacy workforce, you have to be more deliberate in making that available to staff.”","ADM has added a new senior role charged with technology integration, which Howell sees as critical given the return-on-investment that can be attached to new technology — but also given potential missed opportunities if that tech doesn’t work as well as planned. “It’s a bad analogy, but I want to make sure we end up with VHS and not Betamax in everything that’s new,” he says. Otherwise, “you go through training, you go through installation, and you’re going to have to live with it throughout that lifecycle.”","With operations in hotspots like Ukraine and Israel, ADM needs to have action plans in place, outsourced partners lined up, top-shelf intelligence monitoring and more than enough security staff, Howell says. He believes the worldwide instability created by the COVID-19 pandemic has “stretched and challenged” security departments in a good way, to make them prepared for other “out of left field type of stuff.” As travel has ramped up the past few years, he adds, “Maybe that instability has made us less willing to trust that everything will be all right.”","At the National Labor Relations Board in Washington, D.C., Chief Security Officer Raymond Hankins contracts through the Federal Protective Service of the Department of Homeland Security to staff the headquarters building as well as more than 50 locations nationwide. The NLRB is currently “doing more with less” given budget cuts, which has led to an increase in agitation among those with matters before the board, Hankins says.","“Folks get upset more frequently because the service is not what they’re accustomed to,” he says. “When those things occur, our agents have to be able to reassure the person that they’re doing the best they can for them and manage expectations.” New employees who start at the office receive training on how to handle a disgruntled party and summon help, if need be, he adds, while the board also has threat detection technology, electronic access cards, an alarm system, and antiterrorism measures in place to combat potential threats.","Those measures are all “useful when you have someone who is a belligerent party,” he says. “In each location, we have hearings, and the judge has procedures to follow in case things go awry in a courtroom. … There has been an uptick in individuals coming to federal buildings and airports with prohibited items. That’s where threat detection technology is key. Metal detectors, walk-through magnetometers and X-ray machines all help us to shield employees from someone who may be caught up in emotion and not thinking clearly.”","It’s a bad analogy, but I want to make sure we end up with VHS and not Betamax in everything that’s new. [Otherwise] you go through training, you go through installation, and you’re going to have to live with it throughout that lifecycle.","The shooting of Thompson has both made healthcare institutions more uneasy and led to a wave of at least pretend copycats targeting Ballad Health, based in Johnson City, Tennessee, according to Ken Harr, Assistant Vice President and Chief Security Officer. “We’ve had several incidents of people emailing, ‘Hope you die,’ or ‘you should die,’” he says. “Which caused us to take a stronger security stance for our executives.”","The healthcare provider has 150 armed security officers, all employees, and Harr has been working with human resources to boost their pay to help retain them, so fewer leave for law enforcement. In addition, Ballad has rolled out body cameras for all officers. “They do a great job of capturing what is actually being done, instead of… sometimes people like to exaggerate and say, ‘Security said this to me. Security did this to me,’” he says. “It’s been a great tool for our risk managers to go back and look at, when an incident occurs, to validate [or not].”","Lastly, the healthcare provider has plans to roll out weapons detection and visitor management badging systems, and it’s added K9 teams at tertiary facilities. “Sometimes people become upset inside a hospital, and the last thing we need is someone angry with a weapon,” Harr adds. “The K9 teams have been extremely effective in helping to reduce workplace violence incidents, particularly in our emergency departments.”","Northwell Health, in the New York City region, primarily contracts out for its 1,000 or so guards at 28 facilities, providing training for active shooter, de-escalation and domestic violence awareness to combat the explosion of workplace violence in healthcare, says Kenneth Solosky, Director of Corporate Security Training. In 2018, the healthcare provider armed about one-quarter of its force, and it’s implemented weapons detection and visitor management systems.","The domestic violence awareness came about because with more than 100,000 employees, “We’re not immune to the ills of society,” he says, and sometimes those ills show up at the workplace. “It’s a fine line. If you know an employee is suffering, they have every right to tell us, mind your business, and we recognize that. But we wanted to have a mechanism in place [for a domestic violence victim] to say, ‘I need help.’”","Northwell has more than 5,000 cameras systemwide and could introduce artificial intelligence in the near future, among other reasons to help with facial recognition, Solosky says. The corporate office has a drone program that provides pictures and other surveillance of particular sites, or just a presence as needed, he says.","Since arriving at American University after spending 13 years down the road at Georgetown, Jay Gruber, Assistant Vice President and Chief of Police, has been developing a robust threat assessment program to broaden the university’s posture from mainly student-focused to include staff, faculty and people not affiliated with the university, providing regular meetings and training to raise awareness of and elevate response to both internal and external threats.","While there’s no specific concerns that have arisen lately, “When certain things happen in society, say the Charlie Kirk shooting, for example, there’s always people who express opinions on either side of the incident, and sometimes there are polarizing statements made by members of the American University community,” he says. “Then you get a lot of feedback, as I would call it, from the public, who were unhappy by what was said. Depending on their unhappiness, we have to take those things seriously. … If someone says, ‘I’m going to come to campus and find you, and tell you what I think in person,’ that I have to take as a threat.”","Gruber’s force is comprised of 100% university employees, campus special police officer commissioned by the Washington Metropolitan Police Department to have the same powers, and the school has been reasonably successful in recruiting and training people. “It’s never easy in our industry, especially since George Floyd, to hire people interested in this profession, and even harder to retain them,” he says. “Hopefully, we’re rounding a corner where it’s not as bad as it’s been” for the past five years.","The school’s camera and video management system does not have analytics, which makes it labor-intensive to examine footage, and Gruber is researching upgrading that, potentially to include analytics, as well as standardizing the cameras down to a single manufacturer.","“We’re here to return students to their parents after four years in the same shape as they left them,” he says. “When I started in police work, there was no social media. You didn’t have cell phones. You have to adapt in how you get information, and how you process information, and how you use that information. … You have to change the way you do things to accomplish the same goal.”","Las Vegas-based Caesars Entertainment has revamped a couple different aspects of its security stance in 2025, according to Eric Golebiewski, Senior Vice President of Corporate Security. The organization has expanded its use of the Titan HST mass communication system among its team members spread across its 55 North American properties and equipped team members working isolated areas of resorts in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Virginia with Titan HST panic buttons that security alerts dispatch and provides their location, he says. The system also can build chat groups among those working security at a particular entertainment event, including with third-party teams contracted there in the venues, to push out relevant information.","Secondly, Caesars contracted with body camera company Axon to bolster the organization’s 20,000 stationary surveillance cameras in Las Vegas and provide audio to give transparency and context to various incidents that might take place, Golebiewski says. “It captures the emotion of the event,” he says. “You hear what that person is saying, and you get a unique perspective of what that [guard] is encountering and responding to.” And agitated patrons tend to deescalate once they realize they’re being recorded, he adds. Plus, the camera also uploads the video to an encrypted, secure site in case it’s needed for litigation or criminal prosecution.","Caesars also has partnered with Street Smarts VR around a virtual reality training system that helps the armed special response team learn judgment and decision-making in use of force situations and in de-escalation scenarios, Golebiewski says. Guards can virtually learn when to use — and when not to use — pepper spray, handcuffs, batons, tasers and firearms in scenarios developed realistic to the environment in which they will be working, such as hotel rooms or casino floors, he says.","As Manager of Safety & Security for the Atlanta Hawks, a position she left recently, LaTonya O’Neal says she and her staff, who handled back-of-house security for the team, musicians playing concerts and site staff, were always on the alert for anything out of the ordinary, in their downtown Atlanta location.","“There are individuals experiencing homelessness in the surrounding area,” she says. “Our focus was on ensuring that no one was loitering or attempting to gain unauthorized access to the arena. We maintained continuous, 24/7 monitoring of the entire property.”","Hiring and retention can be challenging in a sports and entertainment arena because the job can feel repetitive when no concerts or games are taking place, O’Neal says, and she implemented recognition programs keep the team engaged motivated. Social and political turbulence didn’t have any major impacts despite the central location. “We frequently managed various protests and demonstrations around the arena,” she says. “Whether our officers were stationed on foot or monitoring through cameras, our priority was ensuring the protection and security of the facility.”","The security guarding industry continues to perform well economically, according to Marc Bognar, President of Security ProAdvisors, who compiled this year’s guarding company list in place of the late Keith Oringer. With mergers and acquisitions remaining highly active, regional players expanding rapidly, and companies increasingly adopting new technology, both operationally and customer-facing, the industry is experiencing strong positive trends.","Paladin has quietly executed several deals, including acquisitions from private equity firms such as its recent purchase of Patrol Protect Secure (PPS), Bognar says. Allied Universal also acquired the boutique New York City firm, Mulligan, in recent months.","The broader economy has been a tailwind for the industry, Bognar notes. “Inflation has continued to drop, and we’ve seen another interest rate cut, which is very helpful for the space,” he explains. “Companies will pay less to finance their business from an operating perspective, as well as for acquisitions. Private equity continues to enter the business. I’m getting regular calls from firms looking for platform companies, mostly in the lower to middle private equity space.”","Regional players are growing in part due to heightened security threats, such as the recent United Healthcare shooting and other high-profile violent incidents affecting organizations.
