The organization has expanded its use of the Titan HST mass communication system among its team members spread across its 55 North American properties and equipped team members working isolated areas of resorts in Las Vegas, Atlantic City and Virginia with Titan HST panic buttons that security alerts dispatch and provides their location, he says. The system also can build chat groups among those working security at a particular entertainment event, including with third-party teams contracted there in the venues, to push out relevant information.",

As organizations look for secure, frictionless ways to manage identity, biometrics offer convenience and assurance — no badges to lose, passwords to forget, or phones to carry. As biometric identities become easier to manage within unified access control systems, they will move from specialized deployments to everyday use, redefining how organizations think about secure, seamless access.",

For example, an intercom placed at an exterior gate can provide valuable information to a security officer about the individual who wants access: their physical features, languages spoken, tone, emotion, and more. Are they carrying anything? Is there anyone else with them? If it’s determined that the individual should not have access, then security is ensured because the individual is not near the main entrance. Using video and audio allows you to push the perimeter back a bit further to vet someone even more than just allowing them to register with the visitor management software at a reception desk.”",
